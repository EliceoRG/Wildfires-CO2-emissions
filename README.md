# Wildfires-CO2-emissions

<p align="justify">
In the last decade, several articles have proven that the main factors affecting the biosphere, the stability, and the mechanism of the environment have been the presence of forest fires, affecting thousands of acres annually on forest land surface. When this phenomenon occurs, in addition to potentially causing natural deforestation, it can raise greenhouse gases (GHG) due to the release of considerable amounts of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases are factors of great importance in the contribution to global warming that could modify biodiversity. Several representative factors emitted CO2 gasses, such as burning fossil fuels and industrialization. Until 2019, CO2 emissions caused by wildfires were not considered a carbon released into the atmosphere since it was assumed that the carbon dioxide emitted would be sequestered again in the vegetative regeneration of the forest. That is why this brief analysis was made, to verify how significant the area affected by wildfires is related to CO2 gasses emitted in the United States. The CO2 emissions data were extracted from Our World Data and the wildfires data from the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) from 37 years, from 1983 to 2019 period. Linear regression was performed with a P-value <.05 with an R2 of 0.27. A correlation test between the number of fires, acres, and tons of CO2.
